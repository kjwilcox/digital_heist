I am currently\r\nhosting it in the following dropbox:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/d43z63j86mwh59y/mjOOHesvyB\r\n\r\nThe easiest method is to download this folder as a zip file,\r\nand extract the digital_heist_data folder somewhere on your machine.\r\n\r\nCreate a file in the root directory of the github repository (same\r\ndirectory as this readme) called \"data_location.txt\", and put the\r\ncomplete file path to the data folder inside.\r\n\r\nOnce this file is in place, you can play the game by running:\r\n\r\nmain.py\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
