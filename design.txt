Digital Heist Design Document

Digital Heist (real title pending), is a puzzle action game taking place in 
the cyberpunk future. The main character attempts to pull of heists with the 
help of his/her cyber navigator (need a better name). Gameplay will consist of 
top-down action/stealth gameplay.

The main character will move through locations, avoiding or neutralizing guards,
pressing switches, disabling alarms and security, gathering items, and accessing
computer systems.

The navigator will have a similar gameplay style, but all action will take place 
in cyberspace. The navigator will facilitate entry into these locations. They will 
be tasked with similar objectives: avoiding/neutralizing/repurposing programs,
modifying realworld and cyberspace security, collecting items and information,
and accessing servers and datastores.

The actual cool part about the game is the interplay between the two characters.
Getting through the levels will require switching back and forth between characters 
so that pathways can be opened up. As additional software is aquired, it expands on 
the capabilities of the navigator. Software will be aquired in the realworld and in 
cyberspace. Hardware must be aquired in the real world, although it may be unlocked 
by actions in cyberspace.

A navigator should be called a daemon
