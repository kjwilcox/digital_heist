digital_heist
=============

A game about physical and digital heists in a cyberpunk setting.

The purpose of this game is to showcase my programming abilities.
I will be attempting to actually finish a game. I plan on creating
the art and music assets myself, but I certainly would welcome help
on this front.


This game has the following dependencies:

* Python 3.3
* PyGame 1.9.2a

You can play the game by running:
    main.py
