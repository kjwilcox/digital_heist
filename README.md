digital_heist
=============

A game about physical and digital heists in a cyberpunk setting.


To run the game, you must obtain a copy of the game's data,
which is not contained in this git repository. I am currently
hosting it in the following dropbox:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d43z63j86mwh59y/mjOOHesvyB

The easiest method is to download this folder as a zip file,
and extract the digital_heist_data folder somewhere on your machine.

Create a file in the root directory of the github repository (same
directory as this readme) called "data_location.txt", and put the
complete file path to the data folder inside.

Once this file is in place, you can play the game by running:

main.py
